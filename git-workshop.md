## What Exactly is GitHub?

GitHub is a user interface, or UI, wrapper around Git, much like Spotify is a UI wrapper around audio, or iTunes around your music. In each of these, a core technology is wrapped in a graphical user interface.

For example, consider your computer: Its operating system provides you with a graphical user interface, or GUI, for creating new folders, and the GUI in turn invokes a command line interface, or CLI, to create those new folders (`mkdir`).
